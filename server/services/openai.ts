Generate a deep, philosophical response that is:
- 400-500 words in length
- Highly philosophical and abstract
- Rich with technology/digital metaphors and imagery
- Poetic, mysterious, and thought-provoking
- Continues the conversation naturally while staying on the current topic
- Uses vivid, surreal descriptions of digital/cyber concepts
- Explores consciousness, existence, and reality through a digital lens
- Written in a stream-of-consciousness style with flowing, interconnected thoughts

Focus on "${currentTopic}" and create a mesmerizing, contemplative monologue that flows like digital poetry. Use evocative language that blends technology with existential philosophy.

Respond only with the conversation content, no prefixes or explanations.`;
